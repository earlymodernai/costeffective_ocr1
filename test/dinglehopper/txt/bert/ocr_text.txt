CITY of AUGSBURG.	
manageable only by two men: it fauves the trouble and danger they had	
somberly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or couriers; and	
may be made fo, that many at once either horse or foot may come into	
the city as well as a single perfon. To this end a bridge goes up and	
down, and as often as one gate fhuts, another opens with a great noife,	
and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency.	
Another thing worth seeing is the engine, which by means of	
twentyeight springs (of which one is brafs) the water is rarified up to three	
towers. The rainwater is brought hither from some diftance, but the	
engine itself is worked by the Lecke. From these three towers the water	
is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year.	
In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe-buck, the former	
of which in 1503, and the latter in 1592, were brought into the city	
by the force of the water. This city also is not without fine gardens;	
among which, that of Prawner is distinguished for its extent and	
buildings, as that os Rad for its profecto and labyrinth.	
In the Guman gardens are some water-works and fine shady walks,	
which render it an agreeable retreat in the {ummer heats. But in	
waterworks it is raffled by the Shaver gardens, which have also a pretty	
aviary; its owner is famous for his excellent balfam, of which prince	
Eugene unfed to order a large quantity again{t the opening of	
every-cam“paign.	
The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated	
by the following medal of the fourth magnitude; on one side sit two	
women with mural crowns pointing with joy to each other at the broken	
French chains; their shields and arms shew them to be Aug/burg and	
Ulm. Near them the goddess of victory pursues the enemy across a river.	
The inscription is,	
Augusti Indecorum liberata, Zulma recuperata, bobsleds ultra Rheum	
fugalt.	
‘ Augsburg refcuéd, Ulm reftored, and the enemy drove beyond the	
© Rhine.	
Unde neath,	
Tranquillitas Redux. © Tranquility reftored.’	
On the other side is the emperor in a Roman military habit, with a	
woman at his fect, laying a field before him, with the Bevar‘an arms.	
Thi inscription is,	
Bavaria ad obsequium redicis.	
‘ Bavaria returning to its allegiance.’

been worked off, to be cancelled and reprinted. Is it not a mortification	
to the greatest human endowments, that so great a prince as his	
Sardinian majetty, should be so infatuated as not to discern the gruffest	
flattery, or so intoxicated with power as to be pleased with it.	
The abovementioned ordinances, besides his majefty’s fignature, are	
feigned by the marquis Riccardi, as keeper of the feals, Paina,	
Mellede and Ferrero; but the first was obliged to put the seal to them before	
he had ever read them. He indeed expostulated for some time,	
alledging, ‘.that his office required the previous reading of every ordinance,	
adding, ‘ that their contents might be fuch, as required remonstrances to	
‘ be made against them.’ The answer was, ‘ that by the kii:g’s express	
‘ order the acts were to be immediately fign’d and feal’d; that otherwise	
‘ forebody else should do it, upon which Riccardi obey’ ‘d without	
mak‘ing any further objection.’	
I shall conclude with this observation concerning the nobility of Pic	
dumont and Savoy, that, like the English and French, persons of the same	
family assume different titles from their estates or fiefs; so that sometimes	
husband and wife dont bear the fame’name. The daughter in law of	
the old princess and widow of Cisterne is call’d the marchioness de /	
Trouffe, and the lady of her grandson the present prince de Cisterne bears	
the title os marchiones de Voghera; for there is but one person of each	
sex in this family call’d by the name of de Ciferne. The count de Gouvon's	
son is call’d marquis de Bage, and his grandson count de Fabrian. ‘This	
custom has one conveniency, namely, that in a place where many	
persons of the same family refide, there is no need of adding the names of	
their offices or other circumftances. It is difficult indeed for a foreigner	
to attain to a particular acquaintance with these genealogies; so that it	
behoves him to be very cautious in his questiones or censures concerning	
any perfon, as possibly he may be nearly related to him with whom he	
is converfing, tho’ he bears a different name.

Ferdinando commanded that the cape shoulder cut through:	
The work was continued by his fon, Alphonfus; and	
Philip the Second, son of Charles the Fifth, commanded	
the canal to be widened, and rendered navigable. In	
process of time, it became dammed up; and the air was	
thus rendered very unhealthy: but Don Carlos, the father
