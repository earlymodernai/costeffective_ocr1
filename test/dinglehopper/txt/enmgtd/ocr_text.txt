CITY f AUGSBURG.

nageable only by two men: it saves the trouble and danger they had
formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or couriers; and
may be made so, that many at once either horse or foot may come into
the city as well as a single person. To this end a bridge goes up and
down, and as often as one gate shuts, another opens with a great noise;
and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency.

Another thing worth seeing is the engine, which by means of twenty-
eight springs (of which one is brass) the water is raised up to three tow-
ers. The spring-water is brought hither from some distance, but the
engine itself is worked by the Lecke. From these three towers the water
is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year.
In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe-buck, the former
of which in 1503, and the latter in 1592, were brought into the city
by the force of the water. This city also is not without fine gardens;
among which, that of Rauner is distinguished for its extent and build-
ings, as that of Rad for its prospect and labyrinth.

In the Gulman gardens are some water-works and fine shady walks,
which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats. But in water-
works it is surpassed by the Schaver gardens, which have also a pretty
aviary; its owner is famous for his excellent balsam, of which prince
Eugene used to order a large quantity against the opening of every-cam-
paign.

The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated
by the following medal of the fourth magnitude; on one side sit two
women with mural crowns pointing with joy to each other at the broken
French chains; their shields and arms shew them to be Augfburg and

Ulm. Near them the goddess of victory pursues the enemy across a river.
The inscription is,

Augufta Vindelicorum libcrata, Ulma recuperata, hoftes ultra Rhenum fu-
gati.

« Augsburg rescued, Ulm restored, and the enemy drove beyond the

« Rhine.
Undeineath,
Trangquillitas Redux. « Tranquility restored.”

On the other side is the emperor in a Roman military habit, with a

woman at his sect, laying a shield before him, with the Butarian arms.
The inscription is,

Bataria ad clfequium rediens.

« Bavaria returning to its allegiance.”

been worked off, to be cancelled and reprinted. Is it not a mortification

to the greatest human endowments, that so great a prince as his Sardi-

nian majesty, should be so infatuated as not to discern the grossest flat-
tery, or so intoxicated with power as to be pleased with it.
The above-inentioned ordinances, besides his majesty's signature, are

signed by the marquisses Riccardi, as keeper of the seals, Pamna, Meilla-

rede and Ferrero; but the first was obliged to put the seal to them before

he had ever read them. He indeed expostulated for some time, alledg-

ing, © that his office required the previous reading of every ordinance,

adding, *© that their contents might be such, as required remonstrances to

© be made against them.” The answer was, © that by the kings express
« order the acts were to be immediately fign’d and seal'd; that otherwise

< somebody else should do it, upon which Riccardi obey" d without ma-
< ing any further objection.”

I shall conclude with this observation concerning the nobility of Pic d-
mont and Savey, that, like the English and French, persons of the same
family assume different titles from their estates or fiefs; so that sometimes
husband and wife dont bear the same name. The daughter in law of
the old princess and widow of Cifterne is call'd the marchioness de la
Trouffe, and the lady of her grandson the present prince de Cifterne bears
the title of marchioness de Voghera; for there is but one person of each
sex in this family call'd by the name of de Cifterne. The count de Gouvon's
son is call'd marquis de Bage, and his grandson count de Fabrian. This
custom has one conveniency, namely, that in a place where many per-
sons of the same family reside, there is no need of adding the names of

their offices or other circumstances. It is difficult indeed for a foreigner

to attain to a particular acquaintance with these genealogies; so that it
behoves him to be very cautious in his questions or censures concerning
any person, as possibly he may be nearly related to him with whom he

s conversing, tho' he bears a different name.

they are more remarkable than those of Rome,
notwithstanding that they are not so great in
their circumference. The enigma concerning
these catacombs would not have been equally
difficult, had those who made the inquiry
been pleased to prefer the probable to the mira-

hypothesis.

One fable clings to-another ; like the bats
of Homer, that, in long rows, hang one by the
other from the rocks, and, as soon as one quits
his hold, the rest all fly, hissing, into their
holes.

A misconception of a passage of this great
poet, and the passage which perhaps would
least lead to misconception, gave rise to the
fable of the caverns inhabited by the Cimmerii,
Homer tells us that the empire of Death, and
the cells of the Cimmerii, were at the utmost

bly, every fix hours, the tide is observed to

east and the north of the town; and the bay

ancient town extended far toward the south ;

The Archbishop of Taranto, a No lolitnu

kindness to invite us on the 8th, the morn-

* In the time of Ferdinand the First, of Arragon,
Taranto was a peninsula ; ; but, after Mahomet the Se-
cond, in the year 1480, had taken Otranto, and it was
presumed that he would arrive with his fleet at Taranto;
Ferdinand commanded that the cape shoulde cut through:
The work was continued by his fon, Alphonsus ; and
Philip the Second, son of Charles the Fifth, commanded
the canal to be widened, and rendered navigable. In
process of time, it became dammed up; and the air was
thus rendered very unhealthy : but Don Catlos, the father
of the reigning King, that Don Carlos to whom the
Two Sicilies are so much indebted, in 1755, with the
labour of three years once more opened it ; and since that
time the air of Tatanto is not only healthy but balfamic.

the river In and the Danube, on the west
side of the In, over which is a bridge that
leads to a town called Injtat, right against
which, on the other side of the Danaw,
is Ilizstat, so called from the river Iltz or
ssisfus. Here there is a castle on a high
hill. From Vilshoven the hilly fhores, on
both sides, were fhaded with pine woods,
&c. and from Pafsaw we observed the
Danube to have a swifter stream than
before. We passd by Schnaidersnisfell, a
house built upon a little rock on the right
hand ; and farther on stands a rock in the
river, with a cross upon it. Then we
went by a castle on the left side, and after-
wards, on the same hand, seven miles
from Paffaw, saw Nayhouse castle on a
hill, where some rufticks that rebelled
against the emperor garisoned themselves,
and chained up the Danube. This rebellion
was about 34 years ago; the author of
it, one Stephanus Fatinger. General Pa-
penbeim slew thousands of them in battle,
and dispersed the rest, and the ringleaders
that were taken punished according to
their desert. In the evening we came to our
lodging at Asch, a pretty small village of

In a nobleman's palace, I saw a fellow
who was bitten by a tarantula ; he dan-
ced very antickly, with naked swords, to
a tune played on an instrument : They
say, if the spider be presently killed, no
such effects will appear ; but as long as
it lives, the person bitten is subject to
these paroxysms, and when it dies he is
free Ulually they are the poorer sort
of people that say they are bitten, and
they beg money while they are in these
dancing fits; which makes some think,
that the many stories of the bites of the
tarantula are not true.
