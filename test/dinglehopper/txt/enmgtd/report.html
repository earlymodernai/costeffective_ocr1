for travellers or couriers and may be made so that many at once either horse or foot may come into the city as well as a single person To this end a bridge goes up and down and as often as one gate shuts another opens with a great noise and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency Another thing worth seeing is the engine which by means of twenty eight springs of which one is brass the water is raised up to three tow ers The spring water is brought hither from some distance but the engine itself is worked by the Lecke From these three towers the water is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe buck the former of which in 1503 and the latter in 1592 were brought into the city by the force of the water This city also is not without fine gardens among which that of Rauner is distinguished for its extent and build ings as that of Rad for its prospect and labyrinth In the Gulman gardens are some water works and fine shady walks which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats But in water works it is surpassed by the Schaver gardens which have also a pretty aviary its

for travellers or couriers and may be made so that many at once either horse or foot may come into the city as well as a single person To this end a bridge goes up and down and as often as one gate shuts another opens with a great noise and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency Another thing worth seeing is the engine which by means of twenty eight springs of which one is brass the water is raised up to three tow ers The spring water is brought hither from some distance but the engine itself is worked by the Lecke From these three towers the water is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe buck the former of which in 1503 and the latter in 1592 were brought into the city by the force of the water This city also is not without fine gardens among which that of Rauner is distinguished for its extent and build ings as that of Rad for its prospect and labyrinth In the Gulman gardens are some water works and fine shady walks which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats But in water works it is surpassed by the Schaver gardens which have also a pretty aviary its owner is famous for his excellent balsam of which prince Eugene used to order a large quantity against the opening of every cam paign The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is

first was obliged to put the seal to them before he had ever read them He indeed expostulated for some time alledg ing that his office required the previous reading of every ordinance adding that

one conveniency namely that in a place where many per sons of the same family reside there is no need of adding the names of their offices or other circumstances It is difficult indeed for a foreigner to attain to a particular acquaintance with these genealogies so that it behoves him to be very cautious in his questions or censures concerning any person as possibly he may be nearly related to him
