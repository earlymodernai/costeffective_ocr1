nageable only by two men: it ſaves the trouble and danger they had
formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or couriers; and
may be made ſo, that many at once either horſe or foot may come into
the city as well as a ſingle perſon. To this end a bridge goes up and
down, and as often as one gate ſhuts, another opens with a great noiſe;
and nothing can be better contrived for ſecurity and conveniency.

Another thing worth ſeeing is the engine, which by means of twenty-
eight ſprings (of which one is braſs) the water is raiſed up to three tow-
ers. The ſpring-water is brought hither from ſome diſtance, but the
engine itſelf is worked by the Lecke. From theſe three towers the water
is conveyed to the houſe of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year.
In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe-buck, the former
of which in 1503, and the latter in 1592, were brought into the city
by the force of the water. "This city alſo is not without fine gardens;
among which, that of Rawner is diſtinguiſhed for its extent and build-
ings, as that of Rad for its proſpect and labyrinth.

In the Gulman gardens are ſome water-works and fine ſhady walks,
which render it an agreeable retreat in the ſummer heats. But in water-
works it is ſurpaſſed by the Schaver gardens, which have alſo a pretty
aviary; its owner is famous for his excellent balſam, of which prince
Eugene uſed to order a large quantity againſt the opening of every-cam-
_paign.

"The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated
by the following medal of the fourth magnitude; on one fide fit two
women with mural crowns pointing with joy to each other at the broken
French chains; their ſhields and arms ſhew them to be Augſburg and

Ulm. Near them the goddeſs of vidtory purſues the enemy acroſs a river.

.to the greateſt haman endowments, that ſo great a prince as his Sard:-

nian majeſty, ſhould be ſo infatuated as not to diſcern the groſſeſt flat-
tery, or fo intoxicated with power as to be pleaſed with it,
The above-mentioned ordinances, beſides his majeſty's ſignature, are

ſigned by the marquiſſes R:ccard}, as keeper of the ſeals, Palma, Metlla-

rede and Ferrero; but the firſt was obliged to put the ſeal to them before

: he had ever read them. He indeed expoſtulated for ſome time, alledg-

ing, *.that his office required the previous reading of every ordinance,

adding, * that their contents might be ſuch, as required remonſtrances to

1 ſhall conclude with this obſervation concerning the nobility of Pic d-
mont and Savey, that, like the Engliſh and French, perſons of the ſame
family aſſume different titles from their eſtates or fiefs; ſo that ſometimes
huſband and wife dont bear the fame 'name. The daughter in law of
the old princeſs and widow of Ci/terne is call'd the marchioneſs de /a
Trouſſe, and the lady of her grandſon the preſent prince de Cifterne bears
the title of marchioneſs de Yoghera; for there is but one perſon of each
ſex in this family call'd by the name of de C:/terne., The count de Gouvon's
ſon is call'd marquis de Bage, and his grandſon count de Fabrian. This
cuſtom has one conveniency, namely, that in a place where many per-
ſons of the ſame family reſide, there is no need of adding the names of

their offices or other circumſtances. It is difficult indeed for a foreigner

to attain to a particular acquaintance with theſe genealogies; ſo that it
behoves him to be very cautious in his queſtions or cenſures concerning
any perſon, as poſſibly he may be nearly related to him with whom he

.1s converſing, tho' he bears a different name.
