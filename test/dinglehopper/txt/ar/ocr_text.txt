nageable  only  by  two  men:  it  faves  the  trouble  and  danger  they  had 
formerly  of  opening  the  city  gates  at  night  for  travellers  or  couriers;  and 
may  be  made  fo,  that  many  at  once  either  horfe  or  foot  may  come  into 
the  city  as  well  as  a  fingle  perfon.  To  this  end  a  bridge  goes  up  and 
down,  and  as  often  as  one  gate  fliuts,  another  opens  with  a  great  noife; 
and  nothing  can  be  better  contrived  for  fecurity  and  conveniency. 

Another  thing  worth  feeing  is  the  engine,  which  by  means  of  twenty- 
eight  fprings  (of  which  one  is  brafs)  the  water  is  raifed  up  to  three  tow¬ 
ers.  The  fpring-water  is  brought  hither  from  fome  diftance,  but  the 
engine  itfelf  is  worked  by  the  Lecke.  From  thefe  three  towers  the  water 
is  conveyed  to  the  houfe  of  every  burgher  for  thirteen  guilders  a  year. 
In  one  of  the  towers  are  painted  a  wild  boar  and  a  roe-buck,  the  former 
of  which  in  1503,  and  the  latter  in  1592,  were  brought  into  the  city 
by  the  force  of  the  water.  This  city  alfo  is  not  without  fine  gardens; 
among  which,  that  of  Ranner  is  difilnguifiied  for  its  extent  and  build¬ 
ings,  as  that  of  Rad  for  its  profpedt  and  labyrinth. 

In  the  Gulman  gardens  are  fome  water-works  and  fine  fliady  walks, 
which  render  it  an  agreeable  retreat  in  the  fummer  heats.  But  in  water- 
w'orks  it  is  furpafl'ed  by  the  Schaver  gardens,  which  have  alfo  a  pretty 
aviary;  its  owner  is  famous  for  his  excellent  balfam,  of  w^hich  prince 
Eugene  ufed  to  order  a  large  quantity  againfi:  the  opening  of  every  cam¬ 
paign. 

The  deliverance  of  this  city  from  the  Bavarian  yoke  is  commemorated 
by  the  following  medal  of  the  fourth  magnitude;  on  one  fide  fit  two 
women  with  mural  crowns  pointing  wdth  joy  to'each  other  at  the  broken

to  the  greatefi:  human  endowments,  that  fo  great  a  prince  as  his  Sardi¬

tery,  or  fo  intoxicated  with  power  as  to  he  pleafed  with  it. 

The  above-mentioned  ordinances,  befides  his  majefly’s  fignature,  are 
figned  by  the  marquifles  Riccardi^  as  keeper  of  the  feals,  Palmar  Mei Ha- 
rede  and  Ferrero’y  but  the  firfl:  was  obliged  to  put  the  feal  to  them  before 
he  had  ever  read  them.  He  indeed  expoflulated  for  fome  time,  alledg¬ 
ing,  ‘  that  hisTfiice  required  the  previous  reading  of  every  ordinance, 
adding,  ‘  that  their  contents  might  be  fuch,  as  required  remonflrances  to 
‘  be  made  againfl  them.’  The  anfwer  was,  ‘  that  by  the  king’s  exprefs

fomebody  elfe  fhouid  do  it,  upon  vvdiich  Riccardi  obey’d  without  mak- 
‘  ing  any  further  objection.’ 

1  fliall  conclude  with  this  obfervation  concerning  the  nobility  Pied¬ 
mont  and  Savoy,  that,  like  the  Englifi  and  French,  perfons  of  the  fame 
family  affume  different  titles  from  their  efliates  or  fiefs j  fo  that  fometimes 
hufband  and  wife  dont  bear  the  fame  name.  The  daughter  in  law  of 
the  old  princefs  and  widow  of  Cifterne  is  call’d  the  marchionefs  de  la 
Proiiffe,  and  the  lady  of  her  grandfon  the  prefent  prince  de  Cifterne  bears 
the  title  of  marchionefs  de  Voghera-,  for  there  is  but  one  perfon  of  each 
fex  in  this  family  call’d  by  the  name  of  de  Cifterne.  The  count  de  Gouvons 
fon  is  call’d  marquis  de  Page,  and  his  grandfon  count  de  Fabrian.  This 
cuftom  has  one  conveniency,  namely,  that  in  a  place  where  many  per¬ 
fons  of  the  fame  family  refide,  there  is  no  need  of  adding  the  names  of 
their  offices  or  other  circumflances.  It  is  difficult  indeed  for  a  foreigner 
to  attain  to  a  particular  acquaintance  with  thefe  genealogies;  fo  that  it 
behoves  him  to  be  very  cautious  in  his  queflions  or  cenfures  concerning 
any  perfon,  as  poffibly  he  may  be  nearly  related  to  him.  with  whom  he 
is  converfing,  tho’  he  bears  a  different  name.

thefe  catacombs  would  not  have  been  equally

his  hold,  the  reft  all  fly,  hifiing,  into  their

A  mifconception  of  a  paffage  of  this  great 
poet,  and  the  pafiage  which  perhaps  would 
leaft  lead  to  mifconception,  gave  rife  to  the 
fable  of  the  caverns  inhabited  by  the  Cimmerii, 
Homer  tells  us  that  the  empire  of  Death,  and

This  place  is  feated  at  the  meeting  of 
the  river  In  and  the  Danube ,  on  the  weft 
fide  of  the  7//,  over  which  is  a  bridge  that 
leads  to  a  town  called  Inftat ,  right  againft 
which,  on  the  other  fide  of  the  Danavo , 
is  lltzftat,  fo  called  from  the  river  Iltz  or 
Ifijfus.  Here  there  is  a  caftle  on  a  high 
hill.  From  Vilfhoven  the  hilly  fhores,  on 
both  Tides,  were  fhaded  with  pine  woods, 
&c.  and  from  Paffavo  we  obferved  the 
Danube  to  have  a  fwifter  ftream  than 
before.  We  pafs’d  by  Schnaiderfnijfell ,  a 
houfe  built  upon  a  little  rock  on  the  right 
hand  •,  and  farther  on  Hands  a  rock  in  the 
river,  with  a  crofs  upon  it.  Then  we 
went  by  a  caftle  on  the  left  fide,  and  after¬ 
wards,  on  the  fame  hand,  feven  miles 
from  Pajfaw ,  faw  Nayhottfe  caftle  on  a 
hill,  where  fome  rufticks  that  rebelled 
againft  the  emperor  garifoned  themfelves, 
and  chained  up  th e  Danube.  This  rebellion 
was  about  34  years  ago  •,  the  author  of 
it,  one  Stephanus  Fatinger.  General  Pa- 
penheim  flew  thoufands  of  them  in  battle, 
and  difperfed  the  reft,  and  the  ringleaders 
that  were  taken  punifhed  according  to 
their  defert.  In  the  evening  we  came  to  our 
lodging  at  Afch,  a  pretty  fmall  village  of 
the  emperor’s,  on  the  right  fide  of  the 
river  in  the  upper  Auftria.  The  people 
of  this  country  are  efteemed  very  flout 
and  hardy. 

Below  this  village,  for  fome  diftance, 
there  are  no  hills  by  the  Danube. 

Afcb  is  1 2  German  miles  from  Viljhoven \ 
September  1 4.  Early  in  the  morning  we 
took  boat,  and  had,  on  the  right  hand 
of  us,  a  rock  called  Mons  Calvaries ,  there 


being  a  pretty  little  chapel  built  upon  it. 
Hereabouts  again  we  began  to  have  hills 
on  both  fides  the  river  i  and,  from  that 
chapel,  we  obferved  fix  altars  before  we 
came  four  miles  from  Afch  to  Lintz,  a  very  L;ntz. 
neat  handfome  city  on  the  right  hand, 
feated  on  the  fide  of  a  hill.  The  houfes 
are  fairly  built  of  ftone,  and  have  all  of 
them  flat  roofs.  The  market  place  is  very 
handfome,  being  a  large  fquare  piazza, 
with  two  fountains  in  it.  The  ftreets  are 
badly  pav’d.  On  the  higheft  part  of  the
