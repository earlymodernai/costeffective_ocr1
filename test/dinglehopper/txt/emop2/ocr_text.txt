nageable only by two men: it saves the trouble and danger they had
formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or Couriers; and
may be made. so' that many at once either horse or foot may corne into
the city as well as a single person. To this end a bridge goes up and
down, and as often as one gate shuts' another opens with a great noise.,
and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency-

Another thing worth seeing is the engine, which by means of twenty-
eight springs (os which one is brass) the water is raised up to three tow-
ers. The spring-vvater is brought hither from some distance, but the
engine itself is worked by the Lecke. From these three towers the water
is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a yeat-
ln one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe-buck' the former
of which in 1503, and the latter in 1;92' were brought into the city
by rhe force of the water. This city also is not without sme gardens ;
among u.hich, that of Rauner is distinguished for its extent and build-
ings' as that of Rad for its prospect and labyrinth.

In -the Gulman gardens are some water-works and fine shady walks-'
which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats. But-in water-
works it is surpassed bythe Schaver gardens, which have also a pretty
aviary; its owner is famous for his excellent balsam, of which prince
Eugene used to order a large quantity against the opening of every-cam-
(paign.

The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated
by the following medal of the fourth magnitude; on one side sit two
women with mural crowns pointing with joy to each other at the broken
French chains ; their shields and arms shew them to be Augsburg and

Usm. Near them the goddess of victory pursues the enemy across a river-
The inscription is,

On the other side is the emperor in a Romzm military habit, with a

-to the greatest human endowments' that so great a prince as his isar-di-

tery' or so intoxicated with power as to be pleased with it.
Tlie above-mentioned ordinances, besides his majestys fig gnature, are

signed by the marquiffes thcmdz as keeper of the seals' Painla, Meilla-

rede and Ferrero; but the first was obliged to put the seal to them before

.he had ever read them. He indeed expostulated for some time' alledg-

l shall conclude with this observation concerning the nobility of Pi:d-
mont and Savq).' that' like the English and French' persons of the same
family assume different titles from their estates or ficfs; sothat sometimes
husband and wife dont bear the same-name. The daughter in law os
the old princess and widow of Cisterne is call'd the marchionesh de la
Trouffl' and the lady of her grandson the present prince de Ctsterne bears
the title of marchioness de Voghera; for there is but one person of each
sex in this family call'd by the name of de Czylei.yze. The count de Gouvon's
son rs calld marquis de Bage' and his grandson count de Fabrian This
custom has one conveniency, namely, that m a place where many per-
sons of the same family resïde' there ls no need of adding the names of

their offices or other circumstances. It ls difficult indeed for a foreigner

to attain to a particular acquaintance with thefe genealogies; sothat it
behoves him to be very cautious in his questions or censures concerning
any person, as possibly he may be nearly related to him with w hom he

One fable clings to-another; like the bats

his hold, the rest all fly, hifiing' into their

A misconception of a paffage of this great

least lead to misconception' gave rife to the
fable of the caverns inhabited by the Gimmerii.
