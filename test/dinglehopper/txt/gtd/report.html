           <div class="col-md-6 gt">CITY of AUGSBURG.<br><br><br><br>nageable only by two men: it saves the trouble and danger they had<br><br>formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or couriers; and<br><br>may be made so, that many at once either horse or foot may come into<br><br>the city as well as a single person. To this end a bridge goes up and<br><br>down, and as often as one gate shuts, another opens with a great noise;<br><br>and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency.<br><br><br><br>Another thing worth seeing is the engine, which by means of twenty-<br><br>eight springs (of which one is brass) the water is raised up to three tow-<br><br>ers. The spring-water is brought hither from some distance, but the<br><br>engine itself is worked by the Lecke. From these three towers the water<br><br>is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year.<br><br>In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe-buck, the former<br><br>of which in 1503, and the latter in 1592, were brought into the city<br><br>by the force of the water. This city also is not without fine gardens;<br><br>among which, that of Rauner is distinguished for its extent and build-<br><br>ings, as that of Rad for its prospect and labyrinth.<br><br><br><br>In the Gulman gardens are some water-works and fine shady walks,<br><br>which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats. But in water-<br><br>works it is surpassed by the Schaver gardens, which have also a pretty<br><br>aviary; its owner is famous for his excellent balsam, of which prince<br><br>Eugene used to order a large quantity against the opening of every <span class="cdiff1501 diff ellipsis" >·</span>cam-<br><br>paign.<br><br><br><br>The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated<br><br>by the following medal of the fourth magnitude; on one side sit two<br><br>women with mural crowns pointing with joy to each other at the broken<br><br>French chains; their shields and arms shew them to be Augsburg and<br><br><br><br>Ulm.

           <div class="col-md-6 gt"> CITY of AUGSBURG nageable only by two men it saves the trouble and danger they had formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or couriers and may be made so that many at once either horse or foot may come into the city as well as a single person To this end a bridge goes up and down and as often as one gate shuts another opens with a great noise and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency Another thing worth seeing is the engine which by means of twenty eight springs of which one is brass the water is raised up to three tow ers The spring water is brought hither from some distance but the engine itself is worked by the Lecke From these three towers the water is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe buck the former of which in 1503 and the latter in 1592 were brought into the city by the force of the water This city also is not without fine gardens among which that of Rauner is distinguished for its extent and build ings as that of Rad for its prospect and labyrinth In the Gulman gardens are some water works and fine shady walks which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats But in water works it is surpassed by the Schaver gardens which have also a pretty aviary its owner is famous for his excellent balsam of which prince Eugene used to order a large quantity against the opening of every cam paign The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated by the following medal

of their offices or other circumstances It is difficult indeed for a foreigner to attain to a particular acquaintance with these genealogies so that it behoves him to be very cautious in his questions

           <div class="col-md-6 ocr"> CITY of AUGSBURG nageable only by two men it saves the trouble and danger they had formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or couriers and may be made so that many at once either horse or foot may come into the city as well as a single person To this end a bridge goes up and down and as often as one gate shuts another opens with a great noise and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency Another thing worth seeing is the engine which by means of twenty eight springs of which one is brass the water is raised up to three tow ers The spring water is brought hither from some distance but the engine itself is worked by the Lecke From these three towers the water is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe buck the former of which in 1503 and the latter in 1592 were brought into the city by the force of the water This city also is not without fine gardens among which that of Rauner is distinguished for its extent and build ings as that of Rad for its prospect and labyrinth In the Gulman gardens are some water works and fine shady walks which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats But in water works it is surpassed by the Schaver gardens which have also a pretty aviary its owner is famous for his excellent balsam of which prince Eugene used to order a large quantity against the opening of every cam paign The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated by the following medal

bear the same name The daughter in law of the old princess and widow of Cisterne is call&#39;d the marchioness de la Trousse and the lady of her grandson the present prince de Cisterne bears the title of marchioness de Voghera for there is but one person of each sex in this family call&#39;d by the name of de Cisterne The count de Gouvon&#39;s son is call&#39;d marquis de Bage and his grandson count de Fabrian This custom has one conveniency namely that in a place where many per sons of the <span class="wdiff713 diff" >fame</span> family reside there is no need of adding the names of their offices or other circumstances It is difficult indeed for a foreigner to attain to a particular acquaintance with these genealogies so that it behoves him to be very cautious in his questions or
