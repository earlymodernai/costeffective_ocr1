CITY of AUGSBURG.

nageable only by two men: it faves the trouble and danger they had
formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or couriers; and
may be made fo, that many at once either horfe or foot may come into
the city as well as a fingle perfon. To this end a bridge goes up and
down, and as often as one gate fhuts, another opens with a great noife,
and nothing can be better contrived for fecurity and conveniency.

Another thing worth feeing is the engine, which by means of twenty-
eight {prings (of which one is brafs) the water is raifed up to three tow-
ers. The fpring-water is brought hither from fome diftance, but the
engine itfelf is worked by the Lecke. From thefe three towers the water
is conveyed to the houfe of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year.
In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe-buck, the former
of which in 1503, and the latter in 1592, were brought into the city
by the force of the water. This city alfo is not without fine gardens;
among which, that of Rawner is diftinguifhed for its extent and build-
ings, as that of Rad for its profpect and labyrinth.

In the Gulman gardens are fome water-works and fine fhady walks,
which render it an agreeable retreat in the f{ummer heats. But in water-
works it is furpaffed by the Schaver gardens, which have alfo a pretty
aviary; its owner is famous for his excellent balfam, of which prince
Eugene ufed to order a large quantity again{t the opening of every-cam-
“paign.

The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated
by the following medal of the fourth magnitude; on one fide fit two
women with mural crowns pointing with joy to each other at the broken
French chains; their fhields and arms fhew them to be Aug/burg and

Ulm. Near them the goddefs of victory purfues the enemy acrofs a river.
The infcription is,

Augufla Vindehcorum liberata, Ulma recuperata, bofles ultra Rhenum fu-
galt.

‘ Augsburg refcuéd, Ulm reftored, and the enemy drove beyond the

© Rhine.

On the other fide is the emperor in a Roman military habit, with a

woman at his fect, laying a fhield before him, with the Bavar‘an arms.

been worked off, to be cancelled and reprinted. Is it not a mortification

-to the greateft human endowments, that fo great a prince as his Sard-

nian majetty, fhould be fo infatuated as not to difcern the groffeft flat-
tery, or fo intoxicated with power as to be pleafed with it.
The above-inentioned ordinances, befides his majefty’s fignature, are

figned by the marquiffes Riccardi, as keeper of the feals, Paina, Mertlla-

rede and Ferrero; but the firft was obliged to put the feal to them before

-he had ever read them. He indeed expoftulated for fome time, alledg-

ing, ‘.that his office required the previous reading of every ordinance,

adding, ‘ that their contents might be fuch, as required remonftrances to

‘ be made againft them.’ The anfwer was, ‘ that by the kii:g’s exprefs
‘ order the acts were to be immediately fign’d and feal’d; that otherwife

‘ fomebody elfe fhould do it, upon which Riccardi obey’ ‘d without mak-
‘ ing any further objection.’

I fhall conclude with this obfervation concerning the nobility of Pic d-
mont and Savoy, that, like the Englifh and French, perfons of the fame
family affume different titles from their eftates or fiefs; fo that fometimes
hufband and wife dont bear the fame’name. The daughter in law of
the old princefs and widow of Ci/terne is call’d the marchionefs de /a
Trouffe, and the lady of her grandfon the prefent prince de Cifferne bears
the title of marchionefs de Voghera; for there is but one perfon of each
fex in this family call’d by the name of de Ci/ferne. The count de Gouvon's
fon is call’d marquis de Bage, and his grandfon count de Fabrian. ‘This
cuftom has one conveniency, namely, that in a place where many per-
fons of the fame family refide, there is no need of adding the names of

their offices or other circumftances. It is difficult indeed for a foreigner

to attain to a particular acquaintance with thefe genealogies; fo that it
behoves him to be very cautious in his queftions or cenfures concerning
any perfon, as poffibly he may be nearly related to him with whom he

-is converfing, tho’ he bears a different name.

and the whole Mare Piccolo, which is more

Taranto was a peninfula ; ; but, after Mahomet the Se-
cond, in the year 1480, had taken Otranto, and it was
prefumed that he would arrive with his fleet at Taranto;
Ferdinand commanded that the cape fhouldbe cut through:
The work was continued by his fon, Alphonfus; and
Philip the Second, fon of Charles the Fifth, commanded
the canal to be widened, and rendered navigable. In
procefs of time, it became dammed up; and the air was
thus rendered very unhealthy : but Don Carlos, the father
of the reigning King, that Don Carlos to whom the
Two, Sicilies are fo much indebted, in 1755, with the
labour of three years once rnore opened it ; and fince that
