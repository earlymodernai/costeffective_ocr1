CITY ff AUGsBURG.

nageable only by two men: it saves the trouble and danger they had
formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or couriers; and
may be made so, that many at once either horse or foot may come into
the city as well as a single person. To this end a bridge goes up and
down, and as often as one gate shuts, another opens with a great noise;
and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency.

Another thing worth seeing is the engine, which by means of twenty-
eight springs (of which one is brass) the water is raised up to three tow-
ers. The spring-water is brought hither from some distance, but the
engine itself is worked by the Lecke. From these three towers the water
is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year.
In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe-buck, the former
of which in 1503, and the latter in 1592, were brought into the city
by the force of the water. "This city also is not without fine gardens;
among which, that of Rawner is distinguished for its extent and build-
ings, as that of Rad for its prospect and labyrinth.

In the Gulman gardens are some water-works and fine shady walks,
which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats. But in water-
works it is surpassed by the schaver gardens, which have also a pretty
aviary; its owner is famous for his excellent balsam, of which prince
Eugene used to order a large quantity against the opening of every-cam-
_paign.

"The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated
by the following medal of the fourth magnitude; on one fide fit two
women with mural crowns pointing with joy to each other at the broken
French chains; their shields and arms shew them to be Augsburg and

Ulm. Near them the goddess of vidtory pursues the enemy across a river.
The inscription is,

Augusta Vindelicerum liberata, Ulma recuperata, hostes ultra Rhenum fu-
gatr.

* Augsburg rescued, Ulm restored, and the enemy drove beyond the

« Rhine,

Oa the other side is the emperor in a Roman military habit, with a

woman at his fect, laying a shield before him, with the Buvarian arms.

.to the greatest haman endowments, that so great a prince as his sard:-

nian majesty, should be so infatuated as not to discern the grossest flat-
tery, or fo intoxicated with power as to be pleased with it,
The above-mentioned ordinances, besides his majesty's signature, are

signed by the marquisses R:ccard}, as keeper of the seals, Palma, Metlla-

rede and Ferrero; but the first was obliged to put the seal to them before

: he had ever read them. He indeed expostulated for some time, alledg-

ing, *.that his office required the previous reading of every ordinance,

adding, * that their contents might be such, as required remonstrances to

© be made against them.” The answer was, * that by the ki:g's express
* order the acts were to be immediately fign'd and seal'd; that otherwise

© somebody else should do it, upon which Riccard! obey' d without mak-
© ing any further objection.”

1 shall conclude with this observation concerning the nobility of Pic d-
mont and savey, that, like the English and French, persons of the same
family assume different titles from their estates or fiefs; so that sometimes
husband and wife dont bear the fame 'name. The daughter in law of
the old princess and widow of Ci/terne is call'd the marchioness de /a
Trousse, and the lady of her grandson the present prince de Cifterne bears
the title of marchioness de Yoghera; for there is but one person of each
sex in this family call'd by the name of de C:/terne., The count de Gouvon's
son is call'd marquis de Bage, and his grandson count de Fabrian. This
custom has one conveniency, namely, that in a place where many per-
sons of the same family reside, there is no need of adding the names of

their offices or other circumstances. It is difficult indeed for a foreigner

to attain to a particular acquaintance with these genealogies; so that it
behoves him to be very cautious in his questions or censures concerning
any person, as possibly he may be nearly related to him with whom he

.1s conversing, tho' he bears a different name.

fay, if the spider be presently killed, no
such effects will appear ; but as long as
it lives, the person bitten is subject to
these paroxysms, and when it dies he is
free. Usually they are the poorer sort

they beg money while they are in these
dancing fits; which makes some think,
that the many stories of the bites of the
tarantula are not true.
