CITY of AUGSBURG.	
manageable only by two men: it save the trouble and danger they had	
formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or couriers; and	
may be made fo, that many at once either horse or foot may come into	
the city as well as a single perfon. To this end a bridge goes up and	
down, and as often as one gate fhuts, another opens with a great noife,	
and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency.	
Another thing worth seeing is the engine, which by means of	
twenty eight spring (of which one is brafs) the water is raised up to three	
towers. The printer is brought hither from some diftance, but the	
engine itself is worked by the Lecke. From these three towers the water	
is conveyed to the house of every burgher for thirteen guilders a year.	
In one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe-buck, the former	
of which in 1503, and the latter in 1592, were brought into the city	
by the force of the water. This city also is not without fine gardens;	
among which, that of Awner is distinguished for its extent and	
buildings, as that of Rad for its prospect and labyrinth.	
In the Uman garden are some waterwork and fine shady walks,	
which render it an agreeable retreat in the {ummer heats. But in	
waterworks it is forepassed by the Shaver gardens, which have also a pretty	
aviary; its owner is famous for his excellent balfam, of which prince	
Eugene used to order a large quantity again{t the opening of	
every-cam“paign.	
The deliverance of this city from the Bavarian yoke is commemorated	
by the following medal of the fourth magnitude; on one side sit two	
women with mural crowns pointing with joy to each other at the broken	
French chains; their fields and arms hew them to be Augury and	
Ulm. Near them the goddess of victory pursue the enemy across a river.	
The inscription is,	
Gufa Indecorum liberata, Uma recuperata, boss ultra Rheum	
fugalt.	
‘ Augur refcuéd, Ulm reftored, and the enemy drove beyond the	
© Rhine.	
Unde neath,	
Tranquility Redux. © Tranquility reftored.’	
On the other side is the emperor in a Roman military habit, with a	
woman at his fect, laying a shield before him, with the Bevar‘an arms.	
This inscription is,	
Bavaria ad sequitur redicis.	
‘ Bavaria returning to its allegiance.’

been worked off, to be cancelled and reprinted. Is it not a fortification	
to the greater human endowments, that so great a prince as his	
Saturnian majetty, should be so infatuated as not to discern the offset	
flattery, or so intoxicated with power as to be please with it.	
The intentioned ordinances, besides his majefty’s fignature, are	
signed by the marquis Riccardi, as keeper of the feals, Paina,	
Metalware and Ferrero; but the first was obliged to put the seal to them before	
he had ever read them. He indeed postulate for some time,	
alledging, ‘.that his office required the previous reading of every ordinance,	
adding, ‘ that their contents might be fuch, as required remonstrance to	
‘ be made against them.’ The answer was, ‘ that by the kii:g’s express	
‘ order the acts were to be immediately fign’d and feal’d; that otherwise	
‘ somebody else should do it, upon which Richard obey’ ‘d without	
mak‘ing any further objection.’	
I shall conclude with this observation concerning the nobility of Pic	
dont and Savoy, that, like the English and French, person of the same	
family assume different title from their states or fiefs; so that sometimes	
husband and wife dont bear the fame’name. The daughter in law of	
the old princess and widow of Citrine is call’d the machine de a	
Trouffe, and the lady of her grandson the present prince de Cistern bears	
the title of machine de Voghera; for there is but one person of each	
fe in this family call’d by the name of de Ciferne. The count de Gouvon's	
foun is call’d marquis de Bage, and his grandson count de Fabrian. ‘This	
custom has one conveniency, namely, that in a place where many	
person of the same family refide, there is no need of adding the names of	
their offices or other circumftances. It is difficult indeed for a foreigner	
to attain to a particular acquaintance with these genealogies; so that it	
behoves him to be very cautious in his questions or censure concerning	
any perfon, as possibly he may be nearly related to him with whom he	
is converfing, tho’ he bears a different name.
