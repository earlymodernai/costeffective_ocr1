nageable only by two men: it saves the trouble and danger they had
formerly of opening the city gates at night foi- travellers or couriers; and
may be made- so' that many at once either horse or foot may come into
the city as well as a single person- To this end a bridge goes up and
down, and as often as one gate shuts, another opens with a great noise-.
and nothing can be better contrived for security and conveniency-

Anotlier thing worth seeing is the engine, which by means of twenty-
eight springs (os which one is brass) the water is raised up to three tow-
ers- The spring-water is brought hither from some distance, but the
engine itself is worked by the Lecke. From these three towers the water
is conveyed to the house os every burgher for thirteen guilders a year.
ln one of the towers are painted a wild boar and a roe-buck' the former
of which in rgog, and the latter in Igoa, were brought into the city
by the force of the water. This city also is not without fine gardens ;
among u-hich, that of Rmmer is distinguished for its extent and build-
ings' as that of RAd for its prospect and labyrinth.

In -the szmcm gardens are some water-works and sine shady walks-'
which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats. But-in water-
works it is surpassed bythe Schaver gardens, which have also a pretty
aviary; its owner is famous for his excellent balsam, of which prince
Eugene used to order a large quantity against the opening of every-cam-
-paign-

T he deliverance of this city from the Buvorian yoke is commemorated
by the following medal of the fourth magnitude; on one side sit two
women with mural crowns pointing with joy to each other at the broken
French chains ; their shields and arms shew them to be Augsburg and

Usm. Near them the goddess of victory pursues the enemy across a river-
Tlie inscription is,

-to the greateft human endowments, that fo great a prince as his Surdi-

urim majesty, .sliould be so infatuated as not to discern the grossest flat-
tery' or so intoxicated witlt power as to be pleased with it.
Tlie above-mentioned ordinances, besides his majestys sig gnature, are

signed by the marquiss-es Ricmrd:, as keeper of the seals' Pui'me' -Meillu-

rede and Ferrero; but the first was obliged to put the seal to them before

-he had ever read them. He indeed expostulated for fome time, alledg-

ing' t .that his ossice required the previous reading os every ordinance,

adding' t that their contents might be such' as required remonstrancies to

c be made againft them-' The answer was' t that by the king's express
order the acts were to be immediately sign d and seal';d that otherwise

- somebody else should do it, upon whyich Ricccirdi obey d without mal: -
ing any further obiection.'

l shall conclude with this observation concerning the nobility os Pitd-
mont and Savoy' that, like the English and French' persons of the same
family assume different titles from their estates or siefs; sothat sometimes
husband and wife dont bear the fame-name. The daughter in law os
the old princess and widow of Cistcme is call'd the marchioness de le
Tr0ussb' and the lady of her grandson the present prince de Crylerne bears
the title of marchioness de Vogheru; for there is but one person of each
sex in this family call'd by the name of de Cistei-ne. The count de Gouvon.s
son rs calld marquis de Boge' and his grandson count de Fcebrien This
custom has one conveniency-' namely' that in a place where many per-
sons of the fame family reside' there ts no need os adding the names of

their ofsices or other circumstances lt is dissicult indeed for a foreigner

to attain to a particular acquaintance with these genealogies; so that it
behoves him to be very cautious in his questions or censures concerning
any person, as possibly he may be nearly related to him with whom he

.is conversing' tho he bears a different name

One fable clings to-annther; like the bats

A mil-conception of a paffage of this great
poet, and the paffage which perhaps would
leaft lead to misconceptinn, gave rise to the
fable of the caverns inhabited by the Cimmerii-

the cells ofthe Cimmerii, were at the utmost
